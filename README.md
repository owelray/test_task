# test_task

A simple MVP project, that allows to remember/improve knowledge

# Installation

Everything that was in this project i installed with pip install so I don’t think there should be problems

# Differences from other projects

 Actually i don't know, maybe system of upvotes interesting a bit.

# Complete_status

The only thing I’m not sure about in this code is the periodic task, because the Heroku not adapted to change something inside the project. 

 - Deploy API for testing to Heroku or DevSpace. Add deployment link to the README - https://oweltask.herokuapp.com/api/posts/
 
 - Add Postman collection link to the README - https://www.getpostman.com/collections/0721694ca9a54e4e7572 I hope this is exactly what was needed
 
 - API has to run as a Docker container. API + Postgres should be launched with docker-compose. 
 During the development of the project, everything worked just like that, but I don’t understand for sure how it works on Heroku now.
 - The project should have clear README with steps to run it. - I hope so.
